// stack's identity is a per-worktree project name recorded in tests/.env

// too), and the read/validate/self-heal contract around that record is
// checkable without Docker — each test stands in a throwaway directory for
// tests/. The record is an identity, not a lock: every run of this worktree
// resolves the same project name, which is what lets the next run's
// defensive teardown clean up a crashed one.
