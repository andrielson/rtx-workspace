# AGENTS.md

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues (Andrielson/rtx-workspace), via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default triage label vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Conventions

- Always use the long format for command arguments (e.g., `docker compose --file ... --project-name ...`, not `-f`/`-p`) — it is easier to read for someone unfamiliar with the options. This covers shell commands in general, including `RUN` statements in Dockerfiles and shell scripts such as `docker-entrypoint.sh` and `user-install.sh`. Where a tool has no long options (e.g., BusyBox utilities in Alpine-based images), short flags are fine — leave a comment saying so.
- In Docker Compose files, prefer the long syntax too: volumes as `type:`/`source:`/`target:` entries and ports as `target:`/`published:`, not the `- source:target` or `- host:container` shorthand.
- Prefer nested `.gitignore` files (e.g., `tests/.gitignore`) instead of including everything in the root `.gitignore`.
